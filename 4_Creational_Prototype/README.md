Prototype is a template of any object before the actual object is constructed. It means that it is based on creating duplicate object while keeping performance in constant. Therefore, it can create a number of instances of a class, which has almost same state or differs from some a few differences.  For example :

```
public abstract class ClassName implements Cloneable {
    ....
    
    public Object clone() {
      Object clone = null;
      
      try {
         clone = super.clone();
         
      } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {
         e.printStackTrace();
      }
      
      return clone;
   }
}
```
